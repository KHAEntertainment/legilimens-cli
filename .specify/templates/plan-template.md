# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Validate the plan against the active constitutional principles before proceeding:

- Mission-Led Gateways: Work items keep gateway outputs lightweight, reference static backups, and avoid inlining large docs.
- Immutable Template Format: Planned changes preserve the canonical gateway structure or include an approved amendment path; reference `docs/consitution-original.md` for exact layout verification.
- Naming & Directory Discipline: Proposed files and directories follow `{type}_{name}_{descriptor}.md` inside the mandated `docs/` hierarchy.
- Source Priority Chain: Fetcher work respects detection order (GitHub -> ref.tools, NPM -> Context7, URL -> Firecrawl) and the required fallback attempts.
- Operational Guardrails: Runtime goals (<=10s typical, <=60s large), progress indicators, quality gates, and forbidden-action safeguards remain intact.
- DeepWiki-First Guidance: Plans reinforce DeepWiki MCP as the live knowledge source and ensure gateway outputs include the canonical instructions block.
- Reusable Node.js Core: CLI enhancements consume a shared TypeScript/Node module so other surfaces (e.g., future web services) can adopt the same logic without divergence.

Document any exceptions in "Complexity Tracking" and secure maintainer approval before advancing.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
