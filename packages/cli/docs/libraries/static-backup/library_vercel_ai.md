# AI SDK

[Permalink: AI SDK](https://github.com/vercel/ai#ai-sdk)

The [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs) is a TypeScript toolkit designed to help you build AI-powered applications and agents using popular frameworks like Next.js, React, Svelte, Vue and runtimes like Node.js.

To learn more about how to use the AI SDK, check out our [API Reference](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/reference) and [Documentation](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs).

## Installation

[Permalink: Installation](https://github.com/vercel/ai#installation)

You will need Node.js 18+ and npm (or another package manager) installed on your local development machine.

```
npm install ai
```

## Unified Provider Architecture

[Permalink: Unified Provider Architecture](https://github.com/vercel/ai#unified-provider-architecture)

The AI SDK provides a [unified API](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/foundations/providers-and-models) to interact with model providers like [OpenAI](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai), [Anthropic](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/anthropic), [Google](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/google-generative-ai), and [more](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers).

```
npm install @ai-sdk/openai @ai-sdk/anthropic @ai-sdk/google
```

Alternatively you can use the [Vercel AI Gateway](https://vercel.com/docs/ai-gateway).

## Usage

[Permalink: Usage](https://github.com/vercel/ai#usage)

### Generating Text

[Permalink: Generating Text](https://github.com/vercel/ai#generating-text)

```
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-5', // use Vercel AI Gateway
  prompt: 'What is an agent?',
});
```

```
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-5'), // use OpenAI Responses API
  prompt: 'What is an agent?',
});
```

### Generating Structured Data

[Permalink: Generating Structured Data](https://github.com/vercel/ai#generating-structured-data)

```
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { object } = await generateObject({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4.1',
  schema: z.object({
    recipe: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      ingredients: z.array(z.object({ name: z.string(), amount: z.string() })),
      steps: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});
```

### Agents

[Permalink: Agents](https://github.com/vercel/ai#agents)

```
import { Agent } from 'ai';

const sandboxAgent = new Agent({
  model: 'openai/gpt-5-codex',
  system: 'You are an agent with access to a shell environment.',
  tools: {
    local_shell: openai.tools.localShell({
      execute: async ({ action }) => {
        const [cmd, ...args] = action.command;
        const sandbox = await getSandbox(); // Vercel Sandbox
        const command = await sandbox.runCommand({ cmd, args });
        return { output: await command.stdout() };
      },
    }),
  },
});
```

### UI Integration

[Permalink: UI Integration](https://github.com/vercel/ai#ui-integration)

The [AI SDK UI](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview) module provides a set of hooks that help you build chatbots and generative user interfaces. These hooks are framework agnostic, so they can be used in Next.js, React, Svelte, and Vue.

You need to install the package for your framework, e.g.:

```
npm install @ai-sdk/react
```

#### Agent @/agent/image-generation-agent.ts

[Permalink: Agent @/agent/image-generation-agent.ts](https://github.com/vercel/ai#agent-agentimage-generation-agentts)

```
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { Agent, InferAgentUIMessage } from 'ai';

export const imageGenerationAgent = new Agent({
  model: openai('gpt-5'),
  tools: {
    image_generation: openai.tools.imageGeneration({
      partialImages: 3,
    }),
  },
});

export type ImageGenerationAgentMessage = InferAgentUIMessage<
  typeof imageGenerationAgent
>;
```

import { validateUIMessages } from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();

  return imageGenerationAgent.respond({
    messages: await validateUIMessages({ messages }),
  });
}
```

          {message.parts.map((part, index) => {
            switch (part.type) {
              case 'text':
                return <div key={index}>{part.text}</div>;
              case 'tool-image_generation':
                return <ImageGenerationView key={index} invocation={part} />;
            }
          })}
        </div>
